muKit is a front-end AS3 library (a personal project), available on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/mukit/).

## Background

The project started in 2008 and is now deprecated as of 2012. It defines the backbone for all the ActionScript projects I worked on prior to 2012, containing a set of handy utility classes and visual components meant to speed up the front-end work flow. muKit is used in all my past projects.

## External Dependencies

1.  [TweenLite/TweenMax](http://www.greensock.com/tweenlite/) for tweening
2.  [SWFAddress](http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/) for deep linking
3.  [PaperVision3D](http://blog.papervision3d.org) for 3D stuff
4.  [amfPHP](http://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/) for talking with web services

## Demos

1.  [Dropdown Navigation System](http://v3.6.andrewwei.mu/#/experiment/mukitdropdownnavigationsystem) - reads data from an external XML file and fully supports deep linking using the SWFAddress library. The dropdown menu is fully customizable by the XML file.
2.  [Director](href="http://v3.6.andrewwei.mu/#/experiment/mukitdirector) - a static class that "directs" display objects and aligns them with respect to another display object (usually the stage). If the stage resizes these "directed" objects will realign accordingly.
3.  [Stager](href="http://v3.6.andrewwei.mu/#/experiment/mukitstager) - a static class that pans objects on the stage.
4.  [Papervision3D Camera Controller](href="http://v3.6.andrewwei.mu/#/experiment/mukitpv3dcameracontroller) - handy static class that allows using the keyboard to control the Papervision3D camera.
