Another personal project (formerly called *GZFramework*) - this time a full front-end AS3 framework inspired by gaming UI architectures, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/VARIANTE/VARS.as), fully compatible with [Scaleform](http://gameware.autodesk.com/scaleform).

## Highlights

1.  Various full-featured media components such as `VSImage`, `VSSWF`, `VSSound`, and `VSVideo`.
2.  Powerful wrapper class for the native `Sprite` class that handles advanced user interactions such as drag, press and hold, right click, etc.
3.  Easily customizable transitions when a display object is created/destroyed.
4.  Useful helper classes and utils for manipulating objects.
5.  Includes scrollbar and spreadsheet components.
6.  And more!

## External Dependencies

1.  GreenSock's [TweenMax/TweenLite](http://www.greensock.com/tweenmax/) library (optional, can easily remap to other tweening libraries)
