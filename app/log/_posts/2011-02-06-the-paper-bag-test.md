A Flash piece I made as part of the job application to Blast Radius in Vancouver overnight. There are no specific requirements for the application other than the fact that it has to be Flash and somehow illustrates the theme "Paper Bag". Pretty interesting screening process. Try it out [here](http://v3.6.andrewwei.mu/#/experiment/paperbag)!
