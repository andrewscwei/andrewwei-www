Some settings to tweak on the iPhone to maximize battery life:

1.  **Settings > Wi-Fi**: Turn on Wi-Fi only when you need it.

2.  **Settings > Personal Hotspot**: Turn on this feature only when you need it.

3.  **Settings > Notifications**: Turn off notifications for apps you don't need notifications for.

4.  **Settings > Location Services**: This is a personal preference. Shutting down this feature will save a great deal of battery, but if you really need it on, consider going in and customize location services for individual apps - there might be some that you don't need. The following might interest you:
    1.  **Settings > Location Services > System Services**: These location services are the ones used by the system. There are a few that you might not need, such as Diagnostics & Usage, Location-Based iAds, and Setting Time Zone. Turning those off will squeeze out some more battery life for you.

5.  **Settings > Brightness**: Try to keep this below 50%, and set auto-brightness to off (Apple educates their users to turn this feature on, but I've had better results with it off).

6.  **Settings > General > Siri (iPhone 4S)**: Turn this off if you don't need it. It drains battery while this is on even if you don't use it. Note that turning Siri off will also disable the speech-to-text feature on your keyboard.

7.  **Settings > General > Network**: If you are desperate, disable 3G until you need it.

8.  **Settings > General > Bluetooth**: Switch this off until you need it.

9.  **Settings > iCloud**: iCloud syncs the contents of your phone with the server on a timely basis. This drains battery, though not much. If you don't really need iCloud but have it activated on your phone, remove it.

10. **Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Fetch New Data**: Tweak the fetch frequency. The longer the interval between each fetch, the better the battery life. Note that not all email accounts use the fetch feature so you might not even need11. to tweak this. Gmail uses fetch.

11. **Settings > Music > EQ**: Turn off this feature to preserve more battery when you listen to music.

12. Do a full cycle charge at least once a month. A full cycle charge means draining your device to below 20% and let it charge without any interference back to 100%, for up to 6 hours. Feel free to get a battery maintenance app on the App Store to assist you. A good one is Battery Doctor Pro.

13. Get a portable charger.
